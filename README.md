# 🧠 Chronic Disease Prediction AI
AI agent aligned with UN SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being

This project uses a Machine Learning model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict diabetes risk based on patient health records. Built using Python in Google Colab, it includes explainable AI with SHAP values and an optional Gradio UI for user-friendly interaction. The goal is to support early diagnosis, raise awareness, and provide personalized health recommendations.

# 🚀 Features
✅ Predicts diabetes risk from patient health data

🌿 Supports SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being)

🔍 Uses SHAP for transparent and explainable AI

🧪 Built with Random Forest Classifier

🌐 Optional Gradio UI for live web interaction

📊 Promotes early diagnosis and health education

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Scikit-learn

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

# 🧠 How It Works
Load and preprocess data

Split data into training and test sets

Train a Random Forest Classifier

Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC AUC

Use SHAP for feature impact explanation

Deploy UI with Gradio 

# 📌 Example Output
Prediction: “High risk of diabetes” or “Low risk of diabetes”
